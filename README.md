# Help Guide

This guide aims to provide clear directives for those looking to achieve substantial success in life, particularly financial stability, without taking extreme risks. This is tailored towards individuals aspiring to become millionaires, and not suited for those aiming for fame or billionaire status, as those paths require riskier endeavors. 

The sections below are organized in descending order of importance:

## Financial Guidelines
- **Housing:** Opt for zero or low-cost housing solutions like living with parents or finding extremely affordable rent.
- **Education:**
  - Enroll in a community college, then pursue a technical undergraduate degree in high-demand fields such as Computer Science or Electrical Engineering.
  - If residing in the DMV area, secure a security clearance through internships or job opportunities.
- **Investments:**
  - Open a brokerage account with platforms like Fidelity.
  - Allocate the majority of your earnings into the S&P 500 (stock symbol: VOO) and avoid other stocks. 
    - Diversifying into other stocks can be problematic due to the difficulty in determining sell points and the transient nature of many companies. Short-term investments also incur higher tax rates on gains.
  - Practice disciplined monthly investments regardless of market conditions. Avoid withholding money for perceived market lows.

## Fitness Regimen
- **Routine:** Adopt a Push, Pull, Legs routine.
- **Exercises:** Begin workouts with multi-muscle exercises like squats, followed by at least four other exercises targeting the same muscle groups.
- **Nutrition:**
  - To gain strength, increase your food intake. If ineffective, eat more.
  - To lose weight, reduce your food intake. If ineffective, eat less.
- **Objective:** Focus on building strength in the gym. Your dietary habits should dictate weight management.

## Style Tips
- **Clothing:** Opt for well-fitting clothes without concerning about the price tag.
- **Fabric:** Clothing with higher polyester and lower cotton content can be comfortable and appealing.
- **Merchandise:** Concert merchandise can be purchased online for unique apparel choices.
