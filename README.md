# help-guide

This guide is meant to provide clear directives on how to succeed in life. The guidance provided here is based on the assumption that you want to conduct actions which have a great probabilty of success to achieve great rewards (like become a millionaire, etc). It is not meant for the people who want to become famous or a billionaire. You would have to take riskier actions with lower probability of success than what is described below if you want to become famous or a billionaire.

This guide’s sections are ordered by importance top to bottom:

Financials

•	If you are in the DMV, get a security clearance (from internship or job)
•	Open brokerage account to invest in stocks (Fidelity). 
o	Invest a large majority of the money you make in the S&P 500 (stock symbol VOO). Do not invest in any other stocks.
	If you try to invest in other stocks you will have problems. You will be unable to determine when to sell. Most companies rarely survive over a significant period, so most individual stocks are unlikely to survive. If you do invest only for the short-term, you will get charged income tax rate on your gains and not the lower 15% capital gains rate.
o	Invest monthly with extreme discipline. The market will go down and up. You must be disciplined and invest the majority of your money monthly, even if market is down or up. Do not try to horde money to invest on low market.
